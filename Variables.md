### Introduction to Variables 
A variable refers to a storage location in the computerâ€™s memory that one can set aside to save, retrieve, and manipulate data. Variables act as containers for storing information that can be changed or updated during the execution of a program.

<br/>Every variable has a type, which represents the kind of information you can store inside of it. It tells your compiler how much memory to set aside for the variable, and it defines what you can do with the variable.
